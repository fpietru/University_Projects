Alternatively, before calling getline(), *lineptr can contain a
       pointer to a malloc(3)-allocated buffer *n bytes in size.  If the
       buffer is not large enough to hold the line, getline() resizes it
       with realloc(3), updating *lineptr and *n as necessary.

       In either case, on a successful call, *lineptr and *n will be
       updated to reflect the buffer address and allocated size
       respectively.

       getdelim() works like getline(), except that a line delimiter
       other than newline can be specified as the delimiter argument.
       As with getline(), a delimiter character is not added if one was
       not present in the input before end of file was reached.
